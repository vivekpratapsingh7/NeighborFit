## What Worked Well
- Lightweight stack enabled rapid prototyping
- Score-based ranking was intuitive for users

## Limitations
- No real-time data (e.g., rent changes)
- Static scores lack granularity

## Next Steps
- Integrate OpenStreetMap API for visual context
- Add user feedback to refine algorithm
- Improve scoring using machine learning
