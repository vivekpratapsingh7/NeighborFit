## Problem Statement
People searching for neighborhoods often rely on fragmented platforms that prioritize listings over lifestyle. There's a gap in helping users find areas that match **their lifestyle preferences**, such as safety, affordability, greenery, and walkability.

## Objective
Build a full-stack app that allows users to:
- Set preferences for key lifestyle factors
- Assign custom importance (weights) to each factor
- View best-matching neighborhoods ranked by scores
